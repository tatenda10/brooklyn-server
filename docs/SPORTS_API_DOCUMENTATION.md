## Database Schema

The sports system uses 5 main tables:

1. **sports_categories** - Different sports types
2. **sports_teams** - School teams for each sport
3. **sports_fixtures** - Individual games/events
4. **sports_participants** - Team members and participants
5. **sports_announcements** - Sports-specific announcements

## Migration

To set up the sports system, run the migration script:

```bash
node run-sports-migration.js
```

This will create all necessary tables and insert default sports categories.
